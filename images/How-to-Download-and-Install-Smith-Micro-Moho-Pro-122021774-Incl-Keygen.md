Some of the features of Smith Micro Moho Pro 12.2.0.21774 that make it stand out from other animation software are:

- Revolutionary Smart Bones: This feature allows you to create realistic and smooth movements for your characters by reducing or eliminating distortion around their joints. You can also use Smart Bones to control switch layers, layer order, layer visibility, follow path, flip layer, stroke exposure, shape effect positioning, shape effect parameters, 3D thickness and more[^1^] [^2^].
- Bone Constraints: This feature gives you more options for rigging your characters with complex and powerful constraints. You can use independent angle constraint to make a bone maintain its global angle regardless of its parent bones or inverse kinematics. You can also use squash and stretch bone scaling to make bones squash and stretch objects. Additionally, you can use elbow bending to improve the bending and squashing issues around elbows and knees. Finally, you can use target bones to make bones point in the right direction without having to set angles manually[^1^] [^2^].
- FBX Support for Unity Game Developers: This feature allows you to export your animated 2D content in FBX format and import it into Unity game engine. This eliminates the need to create rigid sprites for game development and gives you more flexibility and control over your animations[^1^] [^2^].
- Motion Tracking: This feature allows you to track the position, rotation and scale of any object in a video and apply it to another object in your animation. This is useful for adding realistic effects such as shadows, reflections, glows and more. You can also use motion tracking to attach objects to moving elements in your video[^1^] [^2^].
- Physics Engine: This feature allows you to simulate realistic physical interactions between objects in your animation. You can apply gravity, friction, bounce, density, springiness and more to your objects and see how they react with each other. You can also use physics to create dynamic hair and clothing for your characters[^1^] [^2^].

These are just some of the features that Smith Micro Moho Pro 12.2.0.21774 offers to help you create stunning animations with ease and efficiency. To learn more about this software and its other features, you can visit the official website[^1^] or watch some tutorials on YouTube[^3^].
