The work covers the entire Quran in 32 volumes, each containing about 500 pages.

Tafseer E Kabeer is considered to be a masterpiece of Quranic scholarship and a valuable resource for anyone who wants to understand the Quran in depth. It is also a testimony to the intellectual prowess and erudition of Imam Razi, who was one of the most influential thinkers of his time.
 
However, due to its complexity and length, Tafseer E Kabeer is not easily accessible to the average reader. Moreover, it has not been translated into many languages, and the available translations are often incomplete or inaccurate.

One of the most remarkable features of Tafseer E Kabeer is the author's biography and personality. Imam Razi was not only a prolific writer, but also a versatile scholar who mastered various fields of knowledge, such as philosophy, theology, alchemy, astronomy, grammar, and logic. He was also a renowned physician who served as the chief physician of Baghdad and Rayy hospitals and wrote several influential medical treatises. [^2^] [^3^]
 
Imam Razi was born in Rayy in 864 or 865 CE into a family of Persian origin. He studied under various teachers and scholars in his hometown and other cities, such as Baghdad, Basra, Kufa, and Isfahan. He was especially interested in philosophy and logic, and was influenced by the Greek atomist Democritus. He also developed his own views on metaphysics, ethics, and theology, which often challenged the orthodox opinions of his time. He was known as Imam al-Mushakkikin (the Imam of Doubters) for his critical and skeptical approach to religious matters. [^2^] [^4^]
 
Imam Razi was also a devout Muslim who performed the pilgrimage to Mecca several times and engaged in debates and dialogues with various religious groups, such as Jews, Christians, Zoroastrians, Mu'tazilites, Ash'arites, and Sufis. He wrote many works on Islamic theology and jurisprudence, such as al-Mabahith al-Mashriqiyya (The Eastern Inquiries), al-Muhassal (The Summary), and al-Tafsir al-Kabir (The Great Commentary). He also wrote a famous refutation of Abu Hamid al-Ghazali's Tahafut al-Falasifa (The Incoherence of the Philosophers), which defended the rationality and validity of philosophy against al-Ghazali's critique. [^2^] [^4^]
 
Imam Razi died in Rayy in 925 or 935 CE after a long and productive life. He left behind a legacy of intellectual excellence and originality that earned him the respect and admiration of generations of scholars and thinkers. His Tafseer E Kabeer is one of his most outstanding works that showcases his mastery of the Quran and its sciences. It is a work that deserves to be studied and appreciated by all who seek to understand the Quran better.
